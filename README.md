# TriviaGame

# Added the Files to the respo

# Created the resetGame function to zero out all the dynamic variables

# Made a startGame to enable the button press and call the get question function

# GetQuestion function is used to load the first question and instaniate the buttons

# Then the choicechecker is selected and used to determine if the button pressed is correct or not

# Then looping back to the getquestion and repeats until all questions in the questions.length are cycled through

# then afterwards the endgame will check the amount of right answers and wrong answers add them together and subtract them to the questions.length to get the amount of missed questions

# added a timeout timer to each question and after the end of the endGame function to restart the game without having to refresh
